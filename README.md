# Easy21 ‚Äì Assignment Solution (David Silver's RL Course)

This repository contains my solution to the **Easy21 assignment** from [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning course at UCL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).

The assignment explores Reinforcement Learning concepts such as:
- Monte Carlo control
- Temporal Difference (TD) learning
- Function approximation
- Eligibility traces (SARSA(Œª))

## 2. Monte-Carlo Control in Easy21

Monte Carlo Control was used to learn the optimal policy through episodic sampling without bootstrapping. The action-value function is updated only at the end of each episode.

### üîç Result:

## 3. TD Learning in Easy21

Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods were applied to compare their performance with Monte Carlo.

### üîç Results:

- MSE vs lambda

- MSE vs episodes for TD(0)

- MSE vs episodes for Monte carlo(Œª=1)

## 4. Linear Function Approximation in Easy21

A linear function approximator with coarse coding to generalize value estimates across similar states.

### üîç Results:

- MSE vs Œª (Linear Approximation)

  ![MSE vs Lambda](/easy21_plots/MSEvslambda_linear_approx.png)

- MSE vs episodes for linear approximated sarsa (Œª=0 and 1)
  Red - Œª=0
  Blue- Œª=1

## 5. Discussion

### ‚Ä¢ What are the pros and cons of bootstrapping in Easy21?



---

### ‚Ä¢ Would you expect bootstrapping to help more in Blackjack or Easy21? Why?



---

### ‚Ä¢ What are the pros and cons of function approximation in Easy21?



---

### ‚Ä¢ How would you modify the function approximator suggested in this section to get better results in Easy21?
