# Easy21 – Assignment Solution (David Silver's RL Course)

This repository contains my solution to the **Easy21 assignment** from [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning course at UCL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).

The assignment explores Reinforcement Learning concepts such as:
- Monte Carlo control
- Temporal Difference (TD) learning
- Function approximation
- Eligibility traces (SARSA(λ))
